# Banana Prince Password Generator (Source)

This is the full source code for the password generator I made. [Try it out here](https://fcard.github.io/BananaPassword/).

Banana Prince is a NES game, it's pretty cool! I figured out the algorithm it uses on its password system so I decided to make a little thing out of it, altho I ended up getting carried away and put way too much effort into it, hehe. I hope you have fun using it!
